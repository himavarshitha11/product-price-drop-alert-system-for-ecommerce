## 📦 Product Price Drop Alert System — Project Documentation

### 🔧 1. Project Setup

This project is designed to monitor the price of a product on Amazon, Flipkart etc and send an email alert to the user if the price drops to or below a specified target. It consists of a Python script (`main.py`) and a simple Flask web interface (`templates/index.html`).

---

### 🌐 2. Key Components

#### ✅ **User Agent**

To access product data from Amazon flipkart etc without being blocked, we use a **User-Agent** string. A user-agent simulates a browser request.
**To find one:**
Search on Google: *"What is my user agent"* — copy the string shown and use it in your code.

#### 🔗 **Product URL & Price Class**

* Go to the Amazon product page.
* Right-click on the product price and select **Inspect**.
* Find the HTML tag that holds the price (typically `<span class="a-price-whole">`).
* Use this class in your Python script to extract the current price.


#### 📧 **Gmail Setup**

To send an email alert from your Gmail:

1. Enable **2-Step Verification** on your Gmail account.
2. Go to **Google Account > Security > App Passwords**.
3. Generate a new app password (16 characters).
4. Use that password in the script instead of your real password.


---

### 🕓 3. Email Alert Setup

You must input the following:

* **Product URL** (copied from Amazon)
* **Target Price** (₹ below which you want an alert)
* **From Email** (sender Gmail)
* **From Email Password** (16-char app password)
* **To Email** (email where alert should be sent)

---

> ⏱️ **Interval Check**
 This sets how often (in seconds) the program checks the product price.
> For example, if set to `60`, the price is checked every **60 seconds**.


### 💻 4. Web Interface

Use Flask to create a simple web page:

* `main.py`: Handles logic and routing.
* `templates/index.html`: The frontend form.

You can run this project locally or deploy it to Replit. The form allows users to enter the above details and click **Check and Send Email**.

---

### 📥 5. Output

When the product price drops to or below the target price:

* You get an email like:

  > 🎉 Price Dropped!
  > The product is now ₹31,998.
  > \[Amazon Link]
